    <section>\n          <h2>Lab's Vision</h2>\n          <p>\n            Welcome to the AI Experience Lab (AEL) founded by prof. <a href=\"http://www.takyeonlee.com\" target='_blank'>Tak Yeon Lee</a> in 2021. The following manifesto guides us to design innovative yet practical solutions using data and AI technology. \n          </p>\n\n          <h3><em>Data-Centric Design</em> over Traditional Industrial Design</h3>\n          <p className=\"indented\">\n            Digital transformation is fundamentally changing how products and services operate and deliver value to people. Data now has become the lens to understand people, and the oil that runs AI-powered machines. AEL's primary goal is to create innovative yet practical solutions for challenging problems. To achieve the goal, we leverage individual researchers' creative and constructive mindsets for finding insights from data, and building prototypes with data and AI technologies. \n          </p>\n\n          <h3><em>System-oriented Design</em> over Human-Centered Design</h3>\n          <p className=\"indented\">\n            While HCD has been a mainstream design agenda for several decades, the world as a giant network of people, businesses, and other stakeholders demands a system-oriented approach. For instance, we may design a system that does not involve any human users, or carefully negotiates the level of discomfort and stress that people experience. \n          </p>\n\n          <h3><em>Minimal Viable Products</em> over High Fidelity Prototypes</h3>\n          <p className=\"indented\">\n            We build a prototype to enlighten ourselves and to step up the next level of design iteration rather than persuading stakeholders with a high-fidelity mock-up.  \n          </p>\n\n\n          <h3><em>Problem Solving</em> over Problem Discovery</h3>\n          <p className=\"indented\">\n            For the last couple decades designers have been very successful at finding interesting problems to solve. However, the digital transformation and AI technology offer unprecedented tools to solve boring (yet challenging) problems. Thus we focus more on innovative solutions rather than problems. \n          </p>\n{/* \n          <h3><em>Media-agnostic</em> over Media-specific</h3>\n          <p className=\"indented\">\n            When people ask \"what do you design?\" we carefully refuse to give a direct answer, because we do not limit ourselves within a specific medium such as user interface, service, or consumer products. Instead we focus on a specific type of problem (e.g. data-driven design issues) that may appear in many different domains. \n          </p> */}\n\n          \n\n{/* \n\n          <h3>1. Explore design opportunities enabled by AI and data</h3>\n          <p className=\"indented\">\n            AEL's primary goal is to create innovative yet practical solutions for challenging problems. To achieve the goal, we leverage individual researchers' creative and constructive mindsets for finding insights from data, and building prototypes with data and AI technologies. \n          </p>\n          \n          <h3>Redefine designer's role and responsibility in the age of digital transformation</h3>\n          <p>\n            In the midst of digital transformation, we see lots of opportunities and problems are only accessible via data. Failing to use data properly may end up creating products that are useful for only a fraction of people, overlooking critical signals of unhappy users, and failing in business. Our research raises critical questions about what designers should learn and do in the age of digital transformation.\n          </p>\n\n          <h3>Back to <em>How</em> from <em>What to design</em></h3>\n          <p>\n            For the last couple decades designers have been very successful at finding novel problems. While the approach is still valid, the digital transformation and AI technology provide unprecedented tools to solve boring (yet challenging) problems. In that line of thought, we are interested in solving an existing (or even boring) problem in a novel way. \n          </p> */}\n\n\n\n        </section>\n        \n        \n        {/* Section.
