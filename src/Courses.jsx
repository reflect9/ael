    <h3>ID403 System Design
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://takyeon.notion.site/ID403-System-Design-c1bb4fc93e5342cfbb8fa32d9fb58fea" target="_blank">Spring 2022 - </a>

    <p>
    ID403 System Design completes the undergraduate curriculum of the Industrial Design department. The entire course focuses on conducting a design project where each project group consists of 4-5 students.  We assume that students have equipped most (if not all) design skills and knowledge for conducting user research, visual communication, building low and high-fidelity prototypes, and evaluate design outcomes. Historically the course had a specific theme for each year. We expect the final outcomes will not only look great but also provide innovative solutions and/or intriguing (or even provocative) messages to the audience. There is no predefined set of lectures, but we will have several sessions for sharing ideas and feedbacks. While we have no plan to get feedback from external audiences, each group will weekly present their progress to the instructor, teaching assistants, and other groups - and get feedback from them.</p>

    <h3>ID408B Data Analytics for Designers
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/reflect9/id430dataanalytics" target="_blank">Fall 2021 - </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
    Design is often considered as an art domain, which excludes objective data-driven analytic reasonings. Such dichotomy is inadequate in the age of data where most products and services are directly / indirectly connected through digital network. Data-driven design is a set of techniques to better understand the problem (e.g. what people want, how people behave), and employ data-driven functionalities to create innovative solutions. Failing to use data at all / properly may end up creating products that are useful for only a fraction of people, overlooking critical signals from people's behavior. In this course students will (1) learn basic concepts of data, (2) get their hands dirty while cleaning, transform, analyze, and visualizing data. Since knowing the dark side of data-driven design is another goal of this course, students will also learn (3) common limitations of data such as bias, ambiguity, sparsity, insufficiency, and how to fight against them.

    How can we design products for the age of data? The goal of this course is to learn basic concepts, potentials, and limitations of data and AI, and to exercise developing AI-infused data-driven products.
