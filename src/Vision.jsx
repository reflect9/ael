        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the AI Experience Lab (AEL) founded by prof. <a href="http://www.takyeonlee.com" target='_blank'>Tak Yeon Lee</a> in 2021. We create innovation solutions for real-world problems by integrating the power of <em>design</em>, <em>data</em>, and <em>AI-technology</em>. 
        </p>

        <h3><em>Data-Centric Approach</em></h3>
        <p className="indented">
            Digital transformation is fundamentally changing how products and services operate and deliver value to people. Data now has become the lens to understand people, and the oil that runs AI-powered machines. AEL's primary goal is to create innovative yet practical solutions for challenging problems. To achieve the goal, we leverage individual researchers' creative and constructive mindsets for finding insights from data, and building prototypes with data and AI technologies.
        </p>

        <h3><em>Pioneering the real-world applications of Generative AI</em></h3>
        <p className="indented">
            Generative AI models such as LLM (Large Language Model) or Image Models have been a hot topic in the research community. However, the real-world applications of generative AI models are still limited. We are interested in exploring the real-world applications of generative AI models, and developing novel design methods to leverage the power of generative AI models.
        </p>

        <h3><em>Pursuing the next design paradigm</em></h3>
        <p className="indented">
            The world is evolving into a giant network of human/non-human stakeholders. It gets harder and harder for designers to satisfy individual end-users. While holding the basic principles of HCD, we treat end-users with the same level of importance as other nodes such as other user groups, businesses, and even AI models. That being said, we try to mediate interests and tensions within the network rather than to satisfy a specific target users.

        <h3><em>Prototype for Iterative Learning</em> over Prototype for Demonstration</h3>
        <p className="indented">
            We build prototypes to test hypothesis, to enlighten ourselves and to step up the next cycle of iterations rather than showing off with high-fidelity prototypes.
        </p>


        <h3><em>Problem Solving</em> over Problem Discovery</h3>
        <p className="indented">
            For the last couple decades designers have been very successful at finding interesting problems to solve. However, the digital transformation and AI technology offer unprecedented tools to get low-hanging fruits (i.e. solving boring yet painful problems). For instance, using AI to remove a single step from daily tasks is as interesting as spotting a novel problem that no one thought.

        {/* 
<h3><em>Media-agnostic</em> over Media-specific</h3>
<p className="indented">
  When people ask "what do you design?" we carefully refuse to give a direct answer, because we do not limit ourselves within a specific medium such as user interface, service, or consumer products. Instead we focus on a specific type of problem (e.g. data-driven design issues) that may appear in many different domains.

<h3>1. Explore design opportunities enabled by AI and data</h3>
<p className="indented">
  AEL's primary goal is to create innovative yet practical solutions for challenging problems. To achieve the goal, we leverage individual researchers' creative and constructive mindsets for finding insights from data, and building prototypes with data and AI technologies. 
</p>

<h3>Redefine designer's role and responsibility in the age of digital transformation</h3>
<p>
  In the midst of digital transformation, we see lots of opportunities and problems are only accessible via data. Failing to use data properly may end up creating products that are useful for only a fraction of people, overlooking critical signals of unhappy users, and failing in business. Our research raises critical questions about what designers should learn and do in the age of digital transformation.
</p>

<h3>Back to <em>How</em> from <em>What to design</em></h3>
<p>
  For the last couple decades designers have been very successful at finding novel problems. While the approach is still valid, the digital transformation and AI technology provide unprecedented tools to solve boring (yet challenging) problems. In that line of thought, we are interested in solving an existing (or even boring) problem in a novel way.
