                In the AI Experience Lab (AEL), our research focuses on data-driven design and AI technology. We do not limit our research scope with a specific medium, user group, or research domain. Instead, our exploration is oriented by individual researchers' creative and constructive mindsets for finding insights from data and utilizing cutting-edge technologies. While the primary goal is to create innovative yet practical solutions to challenging problems, our research also aims to redefine the concept of design by critically asking what designers should learn and do in the age of digital transformation.
