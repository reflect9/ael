        <section>
          <h2>Vision</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to the AI Experience Lab (AEL) founded by prof. <a href="http://www.takyeonlee.com" target='_blank'>Tak Yeon Lee</a> in 2021. We create innovation solutions for real-world problems by integrating the power of <em>design</em>, <em>data</em>, and <em>AI-technology</em>. The following manifesto tells about our approach in detail.
          </p>

          <h3><em>Data-Centric Design</em> over Traditional Industrial Design</h3>
          <p className="indented">
            Digital transformation is fundamentally changing how products and services operate and deliver value to people. Data now has become the lens to understand people, and the oil that runs AI-powered machines. AEL's primary goal is to create innovative yet practical solutions for challenging problems. To achieve the goal, we leverage individual researchers' creative and constructive mindsets for finding insights from data, and building prototypes with data and AI technologies. 
          </p>

          <h3><em>Network-oriented Design</em> over Human-Centered Design</h3>
          <p className="indented">
            The world is evolving into a giant network of human/non-human stakeholders. It gets harder and harder for designers to satisfy individual end-users. While holding the basic principles of HCD, we treat end-users with the same level of importance as other nodes such as other user groups, businesses, and even AI models. That being said, we try to mediate interests and tensions within the network rather than to satisfy a specific target users. 
          </p>

          <h3><em>Prototype for Iterative Learning</em> over Prototype for Demonstration</h3>
          <p className="indented">
            We build prototypes to test hypothesis, to enlighten ourselves and to step up the next cycle of iterations rather than showing off with high-fidelity prototypes.
          </p>


          <h3><em>Problem Solving</em> over Problem Discovery</h3>
          <p className="indented">
            For the last couple decades designers have been very successful at finding interesting problems to solve. However, the digital transformation and AI technology offer unprecedented tools to get low-hanging fruits (i.e. solving boring yet painful problems). For instance, using AI to remove a single step from daily tasks is as interesting as spotting a novel problem that no one thought.
          </p>
{/* 
          <h3><em>Media-agnostic</em> over Media-specific</h3>
          <p className="indented">
            When people ask "what do you design?" we carefully refuse to give a direct answer, because we do not limit ourselves within a specific medium such as user interface, service, or consumer products. Instead we focus on a specific type of problem (e.g. data-driven design issues) that may appear in many different domains. 
          </p> */}

          

{/* 

          <h3>1. Explore design opportunities enabled by AI and data</h3>
          <p className="indented">
            AEL's primary goal is to create innovative yet practical solutions for challenging problems. To achieve the goal, we leverage individual researchers' creative and constructive mindsets for finding insights from data, and building prototypes with data and AI technologies. 
          </p>
          
          <h3>Redefine designer's role and responsibility in the age of digital transformation</h3>
          <p>
            In the midst of digital transformation, we see lots of opportunities and problems are only accessible via data. Failing to use data properly may end up creating products that are useful for only a fraction of people, overlooking critical signals of unhappy users, and failing in business. Our research raises critical questions about what designers should learn and do in the age of digital transformation.
          </p>

          <h3>Back to <em>How</em> from <em>What to design</em></h3>
          <p>
            For the last couple decades designers have been very successful at finding novel problems. While the approach is still valid, the digital transformation and AI technology provide unprecedented tools to solve boring (yet challenging) problems. In that line of thought, we are interested in solving an existing (or even boring) problem in a novel way.

          <h2>How to Join</h2>
          <p>
          We are always looking for students interested in AI-infused products and data-driven design. If you're interested in working with me, please read below and send me an email (takyeonlee at kaist dot ac dot kr).
          </p>
          <h3>Ph.D. student</h3>
          <p>
            An ideal candidate should have some prior research experience and technical skills such as prototyping or machine learning. If you are interested in, please send me an email containing some of the following information,
            <ul>
              <li>Cover letter that summarizes your experience and research interest</li>
              <li>A link to materials that demonstrate your technical capabilities such as source code repositories, a personal website, etc</li>

              <li>Any other information that demonstrates your potential as a researcher</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h3>Master student</h3>
          <p>In KAIST, masterâ€™s program is research-oriented, which means that every student needs to join a research group and writes a thesis. In fact, after admission, students are allowed to select their preferred lab, and the department makes the best effort to accommodate these requests (though acceptance to a specific lab is not guaranteed, as it depends on the number of applications received).</p>

          <h3>Undergraduate Internship</h3>
          <p>
          If you are currently registered as a KAIST student (including a visiting student) and are interested in an internship, independent research in our lab or in starting a URP (Undergraduate Research Program) with me, please send an email with the following information,
          <ul>
            <li>What do you want to achieve at the end of your internship?</li>  
            <li>What research topic are you interested in?</li>
            <li>How long will your internship be? I prefer students to work with me at least for six months, but it's not a hard requirement.</li>
            <li>Any materials that demonstrate your expertise and capabilities such as design brief, video of working prototype, etc</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

              This project aims to build an AI-assisted  authoring tool of immersive data storytelling (IDS). Our tool focuses on maximizing the following benefits of IDS: (1) Meaningful and engaging composition of charts in 3D space, (2) Embodied interaction between presenter and charts, (3) Enabling collaborative data exploration in a virtual space. Our tool makes IDS authoring easier and more effective by automating low-level specifications and recommending semantically meaningful chart arrangements.

              College students regularly spend time on checking their progress toward graduation. 
              MaeHwaSoo is a web-based interactive platform for students to quickly check

              This project was originally initiated by a undergraduate student Minwoo Kim, and now became an open-source
